# WheelChair
Open Medical Designs is a Spanish initiative that supports the development of projects based on Open Source. Our main goal is encouraging people to use 3D printing in order to create new products in the field of health. 
In our project, we are creating an Open Source model of wheelchair which can be printed on plastic using a 3D printer. We need people to support our work and help us in improving our wheelchair prototype to make it cheaper and more competitive. To do so, you would need some knowledge in how to use software such as FreeCAD.

Here you can find all the models to create or redisigns a wheel chair. We use Frecad to edit it.
